# guildcraft
An open source group dynamical and wisdom philosophy for guilds and communities of practice


Culture hackers change our/your world

#guildcraft manifesto v0.2
Affecting change is hard as it involves both problem-solving and collaborating in challenging environments. The human condition is involved and that is both ally and opponent. Change is possible. As practitioners, we have discovered new ways to improve our influence and effectiveness. We have learnt to value:
Influence over power
Dojo over growing
Curiosity over judging
Craft over purpose

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
Rules
1. Start with welcome and creed, This document to be read in full at the start of every meeting, there will then be a founder share
2. Confidentiality: state asks. hacks in the abstract - avoid names, Chatham House rules - share asks/hacks etc. but keep contributors confidential
3. Turn-taking- take turns and have fun sharing stories (cf. Participatory narrative enquiry). Each participant shares an ask, a hack, a trope, an archetype, reacts and/or builds or stays silent then nominates the next person to contribute (much like an Agile stand-up)
4. Brevity: Please keep contributions to approx 3 mins each - when we are all done we can go round again until our time is up
5. Right conduct: refrain from axe-grinding, ad hominem, showboating, selling etc. Foolishness and play strongly encouraged
6. Empathy; we are equal so leave your ego at the door
7. Respect the space; a guild is a sanctified space co-held by facilitator and the membership. We are all responsible for holding people to account and reminding of small violations; participants persistently unwilling to abide by the rules will be excluded
8. Members can suggest changes to rules that will be adopted based on a 60% vote 
9. We provide compassion, wisdom and empathy based on need and free at point of delivery. All are welcome here
10. Is a nice round number <or any other jokey line>
Examples

A: How do I get better at influencing?
H: Read Art of War by Sun Tzu metaphorically. And know your archetypes and plays: trickster, jester, trojan mouse, duality engineering, tempered radical. Allow people to influence you. Dale Carnegie a great read. Tons of other advice to come

	A: How do I get more collaboration across silos in my organisation and more engagement at the grassroots?
A:Lots of great ways. My favourites are to use guilds/communities of practice. My methodology for this is called #guildcraft based on original practice and research. Some of the basics are: 
	1.	Build organically and resist the urge to rush things
	2.	Establish the creed: this is different from a normal meeting. Think: group therapy
	3.	Make it friendly and convivial and learn facilitation skills
	4.	Keep the topic and dynamics unstable and focus on the elephants in the room - thatâ€™s what people have a burning need to talk about
	5.	No agenda - focus on quality conversations
	6.	Build empathy and tolerate silence
	7.	Have a back pocket of tricks to keep it from getting boring
	8.	Cheats: take an existing teams chat on a topic and rename it as a guild - people will assume it is well established and are less self-conscious about joining in
	9.	Play and humour are powerful tools
	10.	Pose provocative questions
	11.	If the group is getting staid, start a new one
	12.	If some people are creating the wrong vibe neglect to tell them about the next one
